> 	 - When you use a web browser to make an HTTPS connection to an IPv6 device, you have to type the address into the browser with brackets around the literal address. Why? Well, a colon is already being used by the browser for specifying a port number. So basically, if you don’t enclose the address in brackets, the browser will have no way toidentify the information. Here’s an example of how this looks:
> 	
> 	          https://[2001:0db8:3c4d:0012:0000:0000:1234:56ab]/default.html

> 	- An IPv6 address is 128 bits long and consists of eight 16-bit fields, each joined by a colon. Each field must contain a hexadecimal number, as opposed to the dotted-decimal notation of IPv4 addresses. In the figure below, the X represent hexadecimal numbers.
> 	- The leftmost three fields (48 bits) contain the site prefix. The prefix describes the public topology that the ISP or Regional Internet Registry (RIR) typically assigns to the site.
> 	- The next field is occupied by the 16-bit subnet ID that you (or another administrator) assigns to the site. The subnet ID describes the private topology, also called the site topology, because it is internal to the site.
> 	- The four rightmost fields (64 bits) contain the interface ID, also called a token. The interface ID is configured automatically from the interface MAC address or manually in EUI-64 format.
> 	- A (normal) IPv6 address has the format y:y:y:y:y:y:y:y, where the y is called a segment and can be any hexadecimal value between 0 and FFFF. The segments are separated by two points, rather than one point. A normal IPv6 address should have eight segments; however, a shorthand notation can be used in the TS4500 management GUI for segments that are zero or have leading zeros."

> 		- ::11.22.33.44 (implica que los seis segmentos IPv6 son cero)
> 		- 2001:db8::123.123.123.123 (implica que los últimos cuatro segmentos IPv6 son cero)
> 		- ::1234:5678:91.123.4.56 (implica que los primeros cuatro segmentos IPv6 son cero)
> 		- ::1234:5678:1.2.3.4 (implica que los primeros cuatro segmentos IPv6 son cero)
> 		- 2001:db8::1234:5678:5.6.7.8 (implica que los dos segmentos IPv6 del medio son cero)

###### 2. DHCPv6 (Stateful)


> 
> - DHCPv6 works pretty much the same way DHCP does in v4, with the obvious difference that it supports IPv6’s new addressing scheme. And it might come as a surprise, but there are a couple of other options that DHCP still provides for us that autoconfiguration doesn’t. And no, I’m not kidding—in autoconfiguration, there’s absolutely no mention of DNS servers, domain names, or many of the other options that DHCP has always generously provided for us via IPv4. This is a big reason that the odds favor DHCP’s continued use in IPv6 into the future at least partially—maybe even most of the time!
>   This means that you’re definitely going to need another server around to supply and dispense all the additional, required information—maybe to even manage the address assignment, if needed!
