###### 1. IP ADDRESSING 


> 	IP addressing, also known as Internet Protocol addressing, is a system used to assign unique numerical addresses to devices connected to a computer network. These addresses are necessary for identifying and locating devices on a network, enabling them to communicate with each other.
> 	
> 	There are two versions of IP addressing in common use today: ==IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6).==
> 	
> 	IP addresses are essential for routing data packets across networks. They serve as the source and destination addresses in the headers of IP packets, ensuring that data reaches its intended recipient. IP addresses are allocated and managed by regional internet registries (RIRs), which assign blocks of addresses to internet service providers (ISPs) and other organizations.

###### **2. IPV4** 

> 
> 	==IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers== represented in decimal format, such as "192.168.0.1". An IPv4 address consists of four octets (8-bit numbers) separated by periods. This addressing scheme allows for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses, which, due to the rapid growth of the internet, has become insufficient.

###### **3. IPV6**

> 
> 	IPv6 addresses, on the other hand, ==are 128-bit numbers represented in hexadecimal format==, such as "2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334". IPv6 provides a significantly larger address space, allowing for approximately 3.4 x 10^38 unique addresses. The adoption of IPv6 is gradually increasing to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the internet.

###### 4. PRIVATE IP ADDRESSES 

> 
> 	In addition to IP addresses, there are also private IP addresses used within local networks to facilitate communication between devices behind a router. These private addresses are not globally routable on the internet and are typically in the ranges of 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.
