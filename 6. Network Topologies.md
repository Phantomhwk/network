###### 1. NETWORK TOPOLOGIES 

> 
> 	Here are some of the most important and commonly used network topologies:
> 		1. Bus topology - All devices are connected to a common central cable called a bus. Easy to set up but entire network is brought down if bus fails.
> 		2. Star topology - All nodes connect to a central switch/hub. Easy to troubleshoot and modify but centralized device is a single point of failure.
> 		3. Ring topology - Nodes connect in a circular fashion with each node connecting to the next. Failure of one node breaks the ring.
> 		4. Mesh topology - Nodes connect directly to as many other nodes as possible. Redundant and robust but complex to set up.
> 		5. Tree topology - Hierachical like branches of a tree. Useful for wide area networks.
> 		6. Hybrid topology - Combination of multiple topologies. For example - Bus within departments and interconnected via ring topology.

> 	The most common topology today is star topology due to easy installation and management through central hubs/switches. Bus topology is still used within racks and chassis level networks. Mesh topologies commonly implemented in large scale networks to provide redundancy.
