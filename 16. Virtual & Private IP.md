###### 1. VIRTUAL IP 


> 
> 	A virtual IP address (VIP) is an IP address that is not connected to an actual physical network interface on a host. Here are some key points about virtual IP addresses:
> 	
> 	- VIPs are logical IP addresses that are assigned to a server, typically a cluster of servers acting as one system.
> 	- Although the VIP is not actually bound to a network interface, it is treated as if it were.
> 	- Traffic that is addressed to the VIP gets forwarded to one of the cluster nodes. This could be load balanced across the cluster.
> 	- The VIP provides a single consistent IP address for clients to connect to, abstracting away the individual cluster nodes.
> 	- If a cluster node goes down, the VIP can float to another live node. This keeps the server cluster reachable via the same IP.
> 	- VIPs can also enable high availability. If a node fails, traffic is rerouted via the VIP to a live node. 
> 	- Virtual IPs allow scalability since new servers can be added to the cluster without changing the VIP.
> 	- VIPs are managed by cluster software that handles the abstraction and traffic direction. Common protocols used include VRRP and keepalived.







###### 2. PRIVATE IPs


>    - The people who created the IP addressing scheme also created what we call private IP addresses. These addresses can be used on a private network, but they’re not routable through the Internet. This is designed for the purpose of creating a measure of much-needed security, but it also conveniently saves valuable IP address space.
>    - To accomplish this task, the ISP and the corporation—the end users, no matter who they are—need to use something called network address translation (NAT), which basically takes a private IP address and converts it for use on the Internet. NAT provides security in that these IP addresses cannot be seen by external users. External users will only be able to see the public IP address to which the private IP address has been mapped
