###### 1. SUBNET MASK 

> 
> 	A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address and divides the IP address into network address and host address. Subnet masks allow routers to determine if a destination IP is on a local subnet or a remote network.
> 	
> 	Here's a more detailed explanation:
> 	
> 	- A standard IP address is 32 bits long. It's made up of a network address and a host address.
> 	- The subnet mask has 32 bits set to 1s and remaining bits set to 0s. The 1s determine the network address, the 0s determine the host address.
> 	- For example, a common subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 (binary 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000). It masks the first 24 bits for the network address and leaves the last 8 bits for the host address.
> 	- When a host wants to communicate with another IP on the network, it performs a bitwise AND operation between the target IP and the subnet mask.
> 	- If the result matches the host's own network address, the target IP is on the same local subnet. The host can directly reach the target via Ethernet/Wifi.
> 	- If the result differs, the target IP is on a remote subnet. The host has to send traffic via its configured gateway router.
> 	- Subnet masks effectively divide larger networks into smaller subnetworks to optimize routing and usage of IP addresses.


> 	In summary, subnet masks split IP addresses into network and host sections to allow routing decisions to be made efficiently. Subnetting allows networks to be divided into smaller, more manageable subnets.
