###### 1. DNS (DOMAIN NAME SERVER)
> 
> 	DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, and other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It translates human-readable domain names into the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices. Here is a more detailed explanation of how DNS works:
> 	
> 	- The DNS namespace is organized in a tree hierarchy. At the top are the root nameservers which serve as the starting point for all DNS queries. Underneath are the Top Level Domain (TLD) nameservers such as .com, .org, .net, and country-specific TLDs. 
> 	- Each TLD contains authoritative nameservers that host information for the domains registered under that TLD. This divides the namespace into zones of authority delegated to organizations or individuals that register domain names.
> 	- DNS works through a client-server model. DNS clients such as browsers and operating systems have resolver software to query DNS servers when translating domain names to IP addresses. 
> 	- When a client needs to resolve a domain name, the DNS resolver first queries a root nameserver to find the address of the TLD nameserver it should contact next. 
> 	- The TLD nameserver then responds with the IP of the authoritative nameserver for that particular domain. The recursive query process continues until the authoritative nameserver for that domain is reached.
> 	- The authoritative nameserver maintains the definitive DNS records (such as A, CNAME, MX, etc) needed to translate the domain name into an IP address. 
> 	- DNS results are cached by resolvers to improve performance and reduce trips to authoritative servers. Time-to-live (TTL) values set bounds on how long records can be cached.
> 	- DNS primarily uses UDP for queries and responses. TCP is used when data size exceeds the 512 byte UDP limit.
> 	
> 	In summary, the hierarchical and distributed architecture of DNS, along with caching and delegation, allows it to efficiently resolve domain names while distributing management and control.
