###### 1. ICMP (Internet control message protocol)

>
> 	- Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) works at the Network layer and is used by IP for many different services. ICMP is a management protocol and messaging service provider for IP. Its messages are carried as IP packets.
> 	
> 	I**CMP packets have the following characteristics:**
> 		- They can provide hosts with information about network problems.
> 		- They are encapsulated within IP datagrams.
>

**> 	- The following are some common events and messages that ICMP relates to, and the two most popular programs that use ICMP:**
> 	
> 		1. Destination Unreachable: If a router can’t send an IP datagram any further, it uses ICMP to send a message back to the sender, advising it of the situation.
> 		2. Buffer Full:  If a router’s memory buffer for receiving incoming datagrams is full, it will use ICMP to send out this message until the congestion abates.
> 		3. Hops Each IP datagram is allotted a certain number of routers, called hops, to pass through. If a datagram reaches its limit of hops before arriving at its destination, the last router to receive it deletes it. The executioner router then uses ICMP to send an obituary message, informing the sending machine of the demise of its datagram.
> 		4. Ping: Ping uses ICMP echo request and reply messages to check the physical and logical connectivity of machines on an internetwork.
> 		5. Traceroute: Traceroute uses IP packet time to live time-outs to discover the path a packet takes as it traverses an internetwork.
