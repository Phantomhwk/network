###### 1. ARP 
> 
> 	ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. It is a protocol used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses on local area networks (LANs)
> 	
> 	-  Each device on a LAN has both an IP address and a MAC address. The IP address is used for logical communication between devices, while the MAC address is used for physical communication on the network.
> 	- When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same LAN, it first needs to know the MAC address of the destination device.
> 	-  The source device sends out an ARP request packet that contains the IP address of the destination device. This ARP request is broadcast to all devices on the LAN.
> 	- The device with the matching IP address sends back an ARP reply containing its MAC address.
> 	- The source device adds this IP-to-MAC address mapping to its ARP cache (table) for future reference. Subsequent packets to this destination IP will now contain the destination MAC address.
> 	- ARP cache entries expire after a configurable timeout. When an entry expires, a new ARP request has to be broadcasted again to retrieve the MAC address.

> 	So in summary, ARP provides the critical function of resolving IP addresses to MAC addresses to facilitate communication on local networks. It allows devices to identify each other at the hardware level using MAC addresses after initial logical communication is established with IP addresses.

> 	- ARP resolves IP addresses to Ethernet (MAC) addresses. arp -a
> 	- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) finds the hardware address of a host from a known IP address. Here’s how it works: When IP has a datagram to send, it must inform a Network Access protocol, such as Ethernet or Token Ring, of the destination’s hardware address on the local network. (It has already been informed by upper-layer protocols of the destination’s IP address.) If IP doesn’t find the destination host’s hardware address in the ARP cache, it uses ARP to find this information.

> 	- As IP’s detective, ARP interrogates the local network by sending out a broadcast asking the machine with the specified IP address to reply with its hardware address. So basically, ARP translates the software (IP) address into a hardware address—for example, the destination machine’s Ethernet address.
