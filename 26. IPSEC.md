###### 1. IPSEC (Internet Protocol Security)

> 
> - It is a set of encryption protocols. (AH - ESP - IKE)
> - In computing, Internet Protocol Security is a secure network protocol suite that authenticates and encrypts the packets of data to provide secure encrypted communication between two computers over an Internet Protocol network. It is used in virtual private networks.
> - GRE by itself provides no security—no form of payload confidentiality or encryption. If the packets are sniffed over the public networks, their contents are in plain- text, and although IPsec provides a secure method for tunneling data across an IP network, it has limitations.
> - IPSec does not support IP broadcast or IP multicast, preventing the use of protocols that need them, like routing protocols. IPSec also does not support the use of  the multi protocol traffic. GRE is a protocol that can be used to “carry” other passenger protocols like IP broadcast or IP multicast, as well as non-IP protocols. So using GRE tunnels with IPSec allows you to run a routing protocol, IP multicast, as well as multi protocol traffic across your network.





###### 2. Authentication Header (AH)/Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)

> 
> - The two primary security protocols used by IPSec are Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).
> 
> 	**Authentication Header (AH)**
> 		The AH protocol provides authentication for the data and the IP header of a packet using a one-way hash for packet authentication. It works like this: The sender generates a one-way hash; then the receiver generates the same one-way hash. If the packet has changed in any way, it won’t be authenticated and will be dropped.
> 		So basically, IPsec relies upon AH to guarantee authenticity. AH checks the entire packet, but it doesn’t offer any encryption services.
> 		This is unlike ESP, which only provides an integrity check on the data of a packet.

> 		- there are five components of ESP
> 
> 		1. confidentiality
> 		2. Data integrity
> 		3. authentication
> 		4. Anti-reply service
> 		5. traffic flow
